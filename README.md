- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Open project in any IDE(Pycharm or VSCode)
- Run `Fake_News_Det.py`, go to the `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
- If you want to build your model with the some changes, you can check the `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb`.
- You can check web app is working fine. Sometimes predictions may be wrong.

## Note
- This project is designed for learning purposes, and I don't believe it is capable of functioning in real-time, as the model was trained on historical and limited data.
- To build a real-time system of this kind, we would require an updated dataset and a model that is retrained at regular intervals. Since news data can change within seconds, our model must also be continuously updated to reflect the latest information.
